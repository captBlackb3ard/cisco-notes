![WiFi Topology](4.0-WLAN-VoIP-WiFi-APs-Config.png)

## Key Concepts & Terms
### Wireless Fundamentals
+ **Service Set ID (SSID)**: The name of a wireless network broadcast by an access point (AP).
+ **BSSID**: The MAC address of a specific AP. Used to identify the AP within a WLAN.
+ **ESSID**: The name of an extended wireless network consisting of multiple APs.
+ **Basic Service Set (BSS)**: A single AP and its associated clients.
+ **Extended Service Set (ESS)**: Two or more BSSs connected by a distribution system (wired LAN).
+ **Ad-hoc Mode (IBSS)**: Peer-to-peer wireless communication without an AP.
+ **Infrastructure Mode**: Wireless communication via an AP connected to a wired backbone.

## Wireless Security
+ **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)**: Legacy encryption, insecure. Uses RC4.
+ **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)**: Introduced TKIP; still vulnerable.
+ **WPA2**: Uses AES-based CCMP — current minimum standard.
+ **WPA3**: Uses SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals) for better protection.
+ **802.1X / EAP**: Enterprise authentication framework using RADIUS.
+ **PSK (Pre-Shared Key)**: Password-based authentication used in home networks.
+ **RADIUS / TACACS+**: Centralised authentication servers.

+ **Security Best Practices:**:
	- Disable WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)
	- Use strong passphrases and WPA3 if supported
	- Employ network segmentation (guest vs internal WLANs)
	- Monitor with wireless IDS/IPS

## Wireless Standards & Frequencies (IEEE 802.11)
+ **Key Frequency Channels**:
	- _2.4 GHz band_: Channels 1–11 (only 1, 6, and 11 are non-overlapping)
	- _5 GHz band_: Many non-overlapping channels; supports DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection)
	- _6 GHz band (Wi-Fi 6E)_: More bandwidth, less congestion

## Wireless Transmission & Antenna Concepts
+ **ISM Band**: Industrial, Scientific, and Medical frequencies — unlicensed spectrum (e.g., 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz).
+ **MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output)**: Uses multiple antennas for increased throughput and reliability.
+ **MU-MIMO**: Multi-User MIMO — serves multiple clients simultaneously.
+ **Beamforming**: Focuses the wireless signal towards a specific device to improve range and speed.
+ **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: Ratio of signal strength to background noise — higher is better.
+ **RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator)**: A measure of the received signal power — used to assess signal quality.
+ **Attenuation**: Signal loss over distance or obstacles.
+ **Interference**: Overlapping frequencies or nearby devices degrading signal quality.
+ **Fresnel Zone**: Elliptical area between transmitter and receiver that must remain clear of obstructions for optimal signal.


## Wireless Network Design & Management
+ **Site Survey**: Assessment of wireless coverage, interference, and placement before deployment. 
+ **Roaming**: Seamless movement between APs in the same ESS. 
+ **Controller-Based Architecture**: APs managed centrally via a wireless LAN controller (WLC). 
+ **Lightweight vs Autonomous APs**: Lightweight APs depend on a controller; autonomous APs operate independently. 
+ **Power over Ethernet (PoE)**: Powers APs through Ethernet cables (IEEE 802.3af/at/bt). 
+ **CAPWAP**: Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points protocol used for communication between APs and controllers.
+ **RRM (Radio Resource Management)**: Automatically optimises channel and power settings.

## Wireless Troubleshooting Metrics
+ **Latency**: Delay between sending and receiving data.
+ **Jitter**: Variability in packet delay — affects voice/video.
+ **Packet Loss**: Indicates interference or weak signal.
+ **Throughput**: Actual data rate achieved.
+ **Ping / Traceroute / Wireshark**: Tools for connectivity and analysis. 
+ **Spectrum Analyser / NetSpot / Ekahau / AirMagnet**: Used for signal analysis and site surveys.
