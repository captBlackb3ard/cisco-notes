# Routing - Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Notes

**NOTE**: 
+ Refer to [0.0 Routing - Concepts & Notes](0.0 -  Routing - Concepts and Notes.md)

## OSPF Summary
+ **How it Works?**
	- Type: Link-State IGP
	- Operation: Routers exchange link-state advertisements (LSAs) to build a complete network topology map.
	- Algorithm: Dijkstra’s Shortest Path First (SPF).
	- Each router computes the best path independently.
+ **Key Features**
	- Hierarchical design (Areas & Area 0 backbone).
	- Fast convergence.
	- Supports Variable Length Subnet Mask(VLSM)/Classless Inter-Domain Routing(CIDR), authentication, and equal-cost multi-path (ECMP).
+ **Metrics**
	- Metric: Cost
	- Calculation: Cost = Reference Bandwidth / Interface Bandwidth (Default Reference Bandwidth: 100 Mbps — can be adjusted).
+ **Drawbacks**
	- More complex configuration.
	- Higher CPU and memory usage (due to full topology database).
+ **Applicable Use Cases**
	- Medium to large enterprise networks needing efficiency and fast convergence.
	- Multi-area design networks (e.g., corporate backbones).

## Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Notes
+ It is a dynamic link-state routing (Layer 3) protocol that efficiently exchanges routing information within an autonomous system.
+ It uses the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm to calculate optimal routes.
+ The “link-state” protocol refers to the fact that the routers keep a detailed and current map of the whole network; every router maintains a link-state database.

## Single vs Multi-Area OSPF
+ OSPF can be configured as either Single or Multi-Area.

### Single-Area OSPF
+ Simplicity: Easier to set up and manage, as all routers are in one area and share the same topology information.
+ Scalability Limitations: A single, large LSDB is maintained by every router, leading to larger routing tables and higher CPU processing and memory requirements.
+ Network Size: Best for small networks where the number of routers and routes are limited, and the overhead is manageable.
+ SPF Impact: Any change within the area requires all routers to rerun the CPU-intensive Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm, updating their LSDBs and routing tables.

### Multi-Area OSPF
+ Segmentation: Divides a large OSPF domain into smaller, hierarchical areas, improving efficiency and scalability. 
+ Reduced LSDB: Each router only holds the detailed topology for its own area, significantly reducing the size of the LSDB and the amount of information that needs to be processed. 
+ Route Summarization: Area Border Routers (ABRs) summarize routes between areas, further reducing the number of Link-State Advertisements (LSAs) that flood the network. 
+ Scalability: Ideal for larger enterprise networks, as it isolates the impact of topology changes to a single area, keeping processing overhead low and improving router stability. 
+ Complexity: Requires more complex design and configuration, particularly for ABRs, which need to manage adjacencies in multiple areas

## OSPF Features
+ **Open Standard**: a free to use protocol that ensures all network protocols are uniform.
+ **Fast Convergence**: designed to rapidly respond to changes int he network & ensure routers & routing tables are quickly updated.
+ **Scalable**: good choice for large & complex networks.
