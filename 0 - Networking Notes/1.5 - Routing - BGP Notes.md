# Routing - Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Notes

## BGP Summary
+ **How it Works?**
	- Type: Path Vector Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP).
	- Operation: Exchanges routing information between Autonomous Systems (ASes).
	- Each route includes AS-path information for loop prevention.
	- Algorithm: Uses policies (not metrics) to decide best paths.
+ **Key Features**
	- Highly scalable (used on the Internet).
	- Policy-based routing (you control route advertisement and acceptance).
	- Supports CIDR and route aggregation.
	- Versions: eBGP (between ASes), iBGP (within an AS).
+ **Metrics**
	- Metric: Path Attributes (not numerical):
		* AS_PATH
		* NEXT_HOP
		* LOCAL_PREF
		* MED (Multi-Exit Discriminator)
		* WEIGHT (Cisco only)
+ **Drawbacks**
	- Complex configuration and management.
	- Slower convergence than IGPs.
	- Heavy resource usage.
+ **Applicable Use Cases**
	- Connecting multiple autonomous systems.
	- Internet Service Providers, multi-homed organisations.
