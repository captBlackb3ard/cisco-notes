# Routing - Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) Notes

## IS-IS Summary
+ **How it Works?**
	- Type: Link-State IGP
	- Operation: Uses TLVs (Type-Length-Value fields) to exchange information and form a topology database.
	- Similar to OSPF but uses ISO addressing (Connectionless Network Services  - CLNS).
+ **Key Features**
	- SScalable and stable for large service provider networks.
	- SSupports multi-level hierarchy (Level 1 = intra-area, Level 2 = inter-area).
	- SProtocol-agnostic (originally not tied to IP).
+ **Metrics**
	- Metric: Cost
	- Calculation: Admin-configured value (no bandwidth-based default).
+ **Drawbacks**
	- More complex to configure and troubleshoot.
	- Less intuitive than OSPF for beginners.
+ **Applicable Use Cases**
	- Large-scale ISP or backbone environments.
	- Multi-protocol and IPv6-heavy networks.
