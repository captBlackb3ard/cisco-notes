# Routing - Routing Information Protocol Notes

**NOTE**: 
+ Refer to [0.0 Routing - Concepts & Notes](0.0 -  Routing - Concepts and Notes.md)

## RIP Summary
+ **How it Works?**
	- Type: Distance Vector Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP)
	- Operation: Routers periodically broadcast their entire routing table (every 30 seconds).
	- Algorithm: Bellman-Ford algorithm
	- Routing Updates: Sent to all neighbours (broadcast or multicast 224.0.0.9 for RIP v2).
	- Hop Limit: Maximum of 15 hops; 16 = unreachable.
+ **Key Features**
	- Simple to configure.
	- Supports both IPv4 (RIPv1/v2) and IPv6 (RIPng).
	- Uses split horizon, route poisoning, and hold-down timers to prevent loops.
+ **Key Features**
	- Metric: Hop Count
	- Calculation: 1 hop per router; lowest hop count = best path.
+ **Drawbacks**
	- Slow convergence.
	- Limited scalability (15-hop max).
	- High bandwidth use due to periodic updates.
+ **Applicable Use Cases**
	- Small, simple, and stable networks (e.g., lab setups or small LANs).


## Routing Information Protocol (RIP) Notes
+ RIP is a distance vector routing protocol that helps routers determine the best path to transfer data packets across the network. 
+ RIP operates on the Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.
+ RIP uses hop count as a routing metric to find the best path between the source and the destination network.
+ RIP is mostly used in small to medium-sized networks.

## Hop Count
+ Hop count is the number of routers occurring between the source and destination network.
+ The path with the lowest hop count is considered the best route to reach a network and therefore placed in the routing table.
+ RIP prevents routing loops by limiting the hops allowed in a path from source to destination.
+ The maximum hop count allowed in the RIP is 15 and a hop count of 16 is considered as network unreachable.

## RIP Features
+ RIP is easy to implement.
+ Updates of the network are exchanged periodically. 
+ Updates (routing information) are always broadcast. 
+ Full routing tables are sent in updates. 
+ Routers always trust routing information received from neighbor routers (aka Routing on Rumors).

## How RIP Works?
+ Each router maintains a routing table where the distance to each destination is maintained.
+ RIP shares these routing tables with neighbouring routers by broadcasting them every 30 seconds.
+ Each router that receives the data, updates their table accordingly, e.g, if a router receives a route that is shorter than its previous data, it will update the date in its table.
+ The maximum 15 hops helps in limiting the size of network that a router can handle.
+ If a route is not updated in six successful cycles ( 180 seconds) in the routing table, the RIP will drop that route and inform rest of the network about the same.
+ Despite being easy to implement, it is more efficient for smaller networks than larger networks (use OSPF and EIGRP).

## RIP Versions
+ **RIPv1**: 
	- Routing Type: Classful.
	- Subnet Mask Information: Does not include subnet mask information in updates.
	- Update Mechanism: Uses broadcast for routing updates.
	- VLSM Support: Does not support Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM).
	- Authentication: Does not support authentication
+ **RIPv2**:
	- Routing Type: Classless.
	- Subnet Mask Information: Carries subnet mask information in updates.
	- Update Mechanism: Uses multicast to the address 224.0.0.9 by default. Can also use broadcast mode.
	- VLSM Support: Supports classless interdomain routing (CIDR) and VLSM.
	- Authentication: Supports basic password-based authentication to prevent unauthorized routes.
+ **RIPng (RIP Next Generation)**:
	- Purpose: An extension of RIPv2 to support IPv6.
	- Key Features: Adds support for IPv6 addressing.
