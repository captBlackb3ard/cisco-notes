# Routing - Configure Router DHCP Relay Agent

## DHCP Relay Agent

+ It is a network device (router or switch) that forwards DHCP broadcast packets from DHCP clients to DHCP servers on a different subnet, enableing clients to obtain IP addresses and other network configuration details from a remote server.
+ Standard routers do not forward IP broadcasts, thus a DHCP Relay Agent is required to bring the gap between clients on one network segment and a DHCP server located on a separate network segment.
+ Benefits:
	+ _Cost Reduction_: It reduces the need to deploy DHCP servers on every subnet/segment.
	+ _Centralised Management_: Allows for the management of all client IPs from a single DHCP server (Single-Point-of-Failure).
	+ _Network Segmentation_: Enables a more structured and scalable network architecture by allowing DHCP clients and servers to exist on different subnets/segments.


## Tasks
1. Create VLAN topology in Packet Tracer & Basic Multilayer Switch/Switch/PC(enable DHCP)/Server Configuration.
2. Enable Layer 3 Switch IP Routing & config DHCP static IP
3. DHCP Server Config: DHCP Pool, Subnet Mask, Useable IP Range, Default Gateway, & DNS Server.
4. Config Layer 3 Office Lan interface to relay DHCP meassages to the DHCP server.
5. Test DHCP Relay Requests & Communication.
