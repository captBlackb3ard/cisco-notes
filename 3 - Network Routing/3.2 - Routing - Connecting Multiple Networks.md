# Routing - Connecting Multiple Networks

## VLANs
+ By default, devices assigned to different VLANs/networks cannot communicate with each other (because they belong to different broadcast domains).
+ Routers are used to facilitate the 'routing' of packets between networks.

## Tasks
1. Create VLAN topology in Packet Tracer & Basic Router/Switch/Endpoint Configuration.
2. Configure router with respective IP addresses and connect the switches.
3. Retest ping between vlans (it should work).
