# 🧠 Cisco Networking Revision Pack

A comprehensive hands-on study resource for mastering **Cisco Routing & Switching** — designed for learners preparing for **CCNA/CCNP certifications** or anyone seeking to strengthen practical networking skills.

This repository combines **concise theoretical notes** and **Cisco Packet Tracer labs** that take you from foundational networking concepts to advanced routing and switching configurations.

---

## 📘 Overview

Networking is best learned through doing — this project bridges the gap between theory and real-world implementation.

Each topic is split into:
- `Markdown (.md)` files — concise explanations, configuration notes, and CLI examples.
- `Packet Tracer (.pkt)` files — ready-to-use lab topologies for hands-on simulation.

This collection aligns closely with Cisco’s core networking curriculum and focuses on **clarity, practicality, and security best practices.**
