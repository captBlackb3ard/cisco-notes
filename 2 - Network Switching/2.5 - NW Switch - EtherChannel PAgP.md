# Network Switching - EtherChannel Configuration using PAgP

+ **EtherChannel**: Cisco's implementation of link aggregation - bundling multiple physical Ethernet links into a single, logical high-speed link.
+ Maximum of 8 links can be aggregated together to form a single link.
+ **AIM**: Increase network bandwidth, provide fault tolerance (traffic shifted to remaining links if one fails), and improve load balancing across a group of ports.
+ **Requirements**: all ports should have:
	+ Same duplex
	+ Same speed
	+ Same VLAN config (native VLAN and allowed VLAN should be the same)
	+ Switch port modes should be same (access or trunk mode)
+ **Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP)**: proprietary protocol to form an EtherChannel and supports 4 interface configuration modes:
	+ *ON*: The interface will be a part of EtherChannel but no negotiation takes place.
	+ *Desirable*: The interface will continuously attempts to convert the interface of the other switch into an EtherChannel. Supported EtherChannel combinations:
		+ Desirable - Desirable
		+ Desirable - Auto
		+ Auto - Desirable 
	+ *Auto*: The interface will become a part of EtherChannel if and only if it is requested by the opposite interface.
	+ *OFF*: No EtherChannel configured on the interface.


### Tasks
1. Create VLAN topology in Packet Tracer
2. Identify + Configure: (switches), trunk links, PAgP channel group number and mode:
	+ Both sides must have the same channel group number.
	+ Only supported mode combinations: Desirable/Desirable or Desirable/Auto
3. Input the port channel number created and configure it as a trunk interface
4. Display etherchannel info using the command: `sh etherchannel`
