# Network Switching - VLAN Trunking Protocol

+ VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) enables the propagation of Cisco switch configuration updates to other network switches in the same VTP domain.
+ AIM: To make it easier to manage and secure a network.
+ Three VTP Modes:
	+ Client Mode - VTP client cannot create, change, or delete its VLAN configuration, but can process and forward vlans.
	+ Server Mode - VTP server can create, change, and delete VLANs & is the default mode for VLANs.
	+ Transparent Mode - Network switch does not participate in the VTP domain but forwards VTP advertisement packets to other switches, and is not altered by VTP advertisements/updates. Its manages its own VLAN configuration but does not forward these VLANs.

### Tasks
1. Create VLAN topology in Packet Tracer
2. Identify & config trunks
3. Identify & config VTP Server switch (VTP Domain, Mode, Password, & Version)
4. Config VTP client switches with VTP domain, mode, password, & version.
5. Config VLANs on VTP server.
6. Verify VLANs automatically propagated to VTP Client switches.


#### Step 2 - Trunk Configuration
**Switch 0**
conf t
hostname SW0
ban motd ^Unauthorised Access is Prohibited. All Activity is Logged.^
enable password cisco123
service password-encryption
int range f0/1-2
switchport mode trunk
exit
do sh vlan

do wr

**Switch 1**
conf t
hostname SW1
ban motd ^Unauthorised Access is Prohibited. All Activity is Logged.^
enable password cisco123
service password-encryption
int range f0/1-2
switchport mode trunk
exit
do sh vlan

do wr

**Switch 2**
conf t
hostname SW2
ban motd ^Unauthorised Access is Prohibited. All Activity is Logged.^
enable password cisco123
service password-encryption
int range f0/1-2
switchport mode trunk
exit
do sh vlan

do wr

**Switch 3**
conf t
hostname SW3
ban motd ^Unauthorised Access is Prohibited. All Activity is Logged.^
enable password cisco123
service password-encryption
int range f0/1-3
switchport mode trunk
exit
do sh vlan

do wr

**Switch 4**
conf t
hostname SW4
ban motd ^Unauthorised Access is Prohibited. All Activity is Logged.^
enable password cisco123
service password-encryption
int f0/1
switchport mode trunk
exit
do sh vlan

do wr


#### Step 3 - Configure VTP Server
**Switch 1**
conf t
! Not required - Switches by default are VTP servers
vtp mode server
! Key configurations
vtp domain domain.com
vtp password cisco987
vtp version 2
exit
sh vtp status

wr

#### Step 4 - Configure VTP Clients
**Switch 0, 2-4**
conf t
vtp mode client
vtp domain domain.com
vtp password cisco987
vtp version 2
exit
sh vtp status

wr

#### Step 5 - Config VLANs on VTP Server
**Switch 1**
conf t
! Verify no vlans present
do sh vlan
! Create vlans
vlan 10
name VLAN10
exit
vlan 20
name VLAN20
exit
vlan 30
nam VLAN30
exit
vlan 40
nam VLAN40
exit
vlan 50
nam VLAN50
exit
do sh vlan

do wr

#### Step 6 - Automatic VLAN Propagation
Confirmed - All 5 VLANs propagated from SW1 (VTP Server) to switches 0, 2 to 4 (VTP Clients).
